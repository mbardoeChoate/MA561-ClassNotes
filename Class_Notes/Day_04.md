## Section 2.5 Introduction

### Topics:

-   Review of Limits and Continuity

-   Limits can be $\infty$ (or $- \infty$) (vertical asymptotes)

-   Limits at $\infty$ (horizontal asymptotes)

-   Desmos Activity

#### Review

Solve these limits

1.  $\lim_{x \rightarrow 2}\frac{x^{2} - 4x - 5}{x - 5}$

2.  $\lim_{x \rightarrow 4}{ln(x^{2} - 3x - 3)}$

3.  $\lim_{x \rightarrow 2^{-}}\frac{x + 1}{x - 2}$

#### Limits that go to infinity

We have learned that functions that have vertical asymptotes have limits
that don't exist. And that is true. But we are going to be a little
"more expressive" about how vertical asymptotes are expressed in limits.

In words:

The notation \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ means that the
values of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ can be made
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ large by taking \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ sufficiently
close to \_\_\_\_ (on either side) but not equal to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

#### Limits at infinity

**Horizontal asymptotes**

Horizontal asymptotes are another example of a limit. They tell us what
the values the function gets closer to as the values for x get extremely
big or extremely small.

The notation \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ means that the
values of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ can be made
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ close to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ by taking
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ sufficiently \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
